Coordinates
-----------

world space --> {0, 0} - {Width, Height}

diameter = bug maxsize div 2

canvas -> {0, 0} -> {Width + 2*diameter, Height + 2*diameter}

{CanvasX, CanvasY} = {WorldX + diameter, WorldY + diameter}

Objects
-------

World <--> Body <--> Brain

World
    Keeps track of objects
    Handles moves
    Provides information about the environment (e.g. do we have food around?)

Body
    Implements "parameters" of the species
    Holds genes
    Handles interaction with the environment (turns, moves, eating, etc)
    Keeps track of energy

Brain
    does the job! :)
    decides what to do next
    keeps the body busy
